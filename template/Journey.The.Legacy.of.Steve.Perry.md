Steve Perry's voice and style defined Journey's sound and identity, as he co-wrote and sang some of their most iconic songs, such as "Don't Stop Believin'", "Faithfully", "Open Arms", "Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)", and "Who's Crying Now". His vocal range, emotion, and versatility made him one of the most admired singers of his generation, and influenced many artists who came after him.
 
However, Perry's departure from Journey marked the end of an era for the band and their fans. Perry left due to personal and professional reasons, including health issues, creative differences, and burnout. He pursued a solo career, releasing two albums in 1984 and 1994, but never achieved the same level of success as he did with Journey. He also became reclusive and avoided the public eye for many years, leading to rumors and speculations about his whereabouts and well-being.
 
In 1996, Perry reunited with Journey for a brief period, recording a new album called Trial by Fire, which was nominated for a Grammy Award. However, he did not tour with the band, as he suffered a hip injury that required surgery. He declined to undergo the operation, which led to a rift with his bandmates, who decided to replace him with a new singer. Perry has not performed with Journey since then, although he has expressed his appreciation and respect for them.
 
In 2005, Journey fans were delighted to discover that Perry had released a compilation album called The Essential Steve Perry, which featured his solo hits and some rare tracks. The album was well-received by critics and listeners alike, who praised Perry's voice and legacy. In 2007, Perry made a surprise appearance at a ceremony honoring Journey's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, where he thanked the fans for their support.
 
In 2018, Perry made a comeback with his third solo album, Traces, which was inspired by his personal experiences of loss and love. The album was warmly welcomed by fans and critics, who noted that Perry's voice had matured but still retained its soulful quality. Perry also gave several interviews and performances to promote his album, showing that he was still passionate about music.

After Steve Perry left Journey, the band went through several lineup changes and experimented with different musical styles. They hired Steve Augeri as their new lead singer in 1998, who sounded similar to Perry but had his own personality. Augeri recorded three albums with Journey: Arrival (2001), Red 13 (2002), and Generations (2005). However, he developed a chronic throat infection that affected his singing ability, and was replaced by Jeff Scott Soto in 2006.
 
Soto only lasted for one year with Journey, as he did not fit well with the band's image and direction. In 2007, Journey found their current lead singer, Arnel Pineda, who was discovered on YouTube by guitarist Neal Schon. Pineda, who is from the Philippines, impressed the band with his vocal resemblance to Perry and his energetic stage presence. He made his debut with Journey on their album Revelation (2008), which was a commercial and critical success.
 
Pineda has been praised by fans and critics for his performance and dedication to Journey, as well as for bringing a new and diverse audience to the band. He has also received support and encouragement from Perry, who said that he was happy for Pineda and that he had a great voice. Pineda has recorded two more albums with Journey: Eclipse (2011) and The Frontiers Tour (2013).
 
Journey is still active and touring today, with Pineda as their lead singer. They have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017, where Perry made a rare appearance and gave a heartfelt speech. He did not perform with the band, however, saying that he wanted to respect Pineda's role. He also said that he still loved Journey and that they were his brothers.
